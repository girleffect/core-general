OpenID Connect
==============

What is OpenID Connect?
-----------------------

OpenID Connect (OIDC) is a simple mechanism based on the OAuth 2.0
specification, to allow a client application to contact an identity
provider (IP) in order verify the identities of end-users through
authentication by the Authentication Server, and obtain details of
authenticated sessions and end-users (Connect2id.com, 2018).

OIDC has a lot of the same details that OAuth has, such as the *client_id*, *client_secret*, and *redirect_uri*,
that is stored by the IP to ensure that the information is sent back to the correct client application. This
prevents someone from stealing the *client_id* and using it to have information sent to their own URI (Offenhartz, 2017).


How does OIDC work?
-------------------
An example of a web-based OIDC flow (Auth0, 2018):

1. A client app (Relying Party) sends and authorization request to the Identity Provider (e.g. Google, Facebook, GE Authentication Service).
2. The Identity Provider authenticates the credentials or provides a login screen to the end-user, and asks for authorization (or consent).
3. Once authorized, the Identity Provider sends an access token and an ID token back to the Relying Party.
4. The Relying Party can then use the access token to invoke the services of the Identity Provider.
